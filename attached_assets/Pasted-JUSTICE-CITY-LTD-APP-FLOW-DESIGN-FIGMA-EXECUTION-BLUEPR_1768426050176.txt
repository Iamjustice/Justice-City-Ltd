JUSTICE CITY LTD — APP FLOW DESIGN (FIGMA EXECUTION BLUEPRINT)

Outcome:
When this is followed inside Figma:
	•	Every frame is placed correctly
	•	Every connection is wired correctly
	•	Every gate is visually enforced
	•	Prototypes behave exactly like the backend logic

⸻

STEP 1 — CREATE FIGMA FILE (MANDATORY SETUP)

File name

Justice City — App Flow Design (V1)

Pages (Create exactly in this order):
	1.	00_System_Map

	4.	03_Seller_Agent_Flow
	5.	04_Professional_Services
	6.	05_Admin_Dashboard
